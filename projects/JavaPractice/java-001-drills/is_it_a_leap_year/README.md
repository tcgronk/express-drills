# Is it a leap year?

Write a program that accepts an integer representing a year from the user. Determine if the year provided is a leap year or not. Leap years are divisible by four except when divisible by one hundred. However, years divisible by four hundred are leap years. Ensure that the year lies in the range 1584 to 3000, otherwise display an error message for the user. For example 1900 and 1983 are not leap years but 1984 and 2000 are leap years.
