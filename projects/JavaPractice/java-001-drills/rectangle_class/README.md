# Rectangle class

A Rectangle may be represented by the (x, y) coordinate of its top left hand corner and its width and height. Write a class named Rectangle with two constructors, a no argument constructor that set reasonable defaults for the instance variables and a constructor that accepts four values: x, y, width and height and sets the instance variables appropriately. Write JUnit tests for the class.
