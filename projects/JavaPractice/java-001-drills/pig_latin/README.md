# Pig Latin generator

Write a program that accepts a word and translates it into its pig latin equivalent. 

The simplified rules of pig latin are:

1. IF the word begins with a consonant, move all letters up to the first vowel to the end of the word and add “ay”. For example, “pig” => “igpay” and “duck” => “uckday” and “smile” => “ilesmay”. 
2. If the word begins with a vowel just add “way” to the end of the word. For example, “eat” => “eatway” and “execute” => “executeway”.
