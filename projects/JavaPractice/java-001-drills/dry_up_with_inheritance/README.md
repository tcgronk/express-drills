# DRY up with inheritance

Clone this repository and navigate to this. 

```bash
 cd dry_up_with_inheritance
```

This folder contains several classes found in the src directory that are fully implemented. However,there is some duplication of code involved. Refactor the code using inheritance and composition to avoid duplication of code where possible. All tests should continue to pass.

To run the tests

```
 gradle test
```
