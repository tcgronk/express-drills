# Word counter

Consider the Java program found in the scaffolding folder in this directory.

This program reads a text file and stores the content of the file in a variable named text. The `countWords` method accepts the text and returns a count of all the unique words found in the text. However, this method is not yet written. Complete this method and add some test cases to fully test its functionality.
