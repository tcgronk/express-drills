# 2.3 Moar leap years

Modify your program from the [Is it a leap year drill](../is_it_a_leap_year) drill to prompt the user asking whether they want to work out another year or not. If the user wishes to check another year then prompt for the year and determine if it is a leap year or not. Repeat until the user chooses to stop.

Hint: you'll need to use a `do...while` loop.
